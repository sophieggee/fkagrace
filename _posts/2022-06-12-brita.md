i am filling up the ice tray for my roommate (who lives in my heart as well) as i head out of town, and all of the sudden i am thinking of it as **"Doing What I Can for the Community"** (giving back in a small way (walking the talk)) 

and then i remember about all the times my mom nagged us about refilling the **Nearly Empty Brita Filter Pitcher**. and i wonder if i’ve grown and somehow the act of me filling up this tray on my way out of town is a big fat symbol of that— 

or maybe does it mean something i'm scared of: that i’m better at serving my roommate than my parents. 

here i will say that that pitcher met it’s demise by being thrown into the backyard in the night as a half-joke-half-statement made by my dad who was fed up with all the back and forth anyway.
