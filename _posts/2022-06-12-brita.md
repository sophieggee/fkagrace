i was filling up the ice tray for my roommates as i headed out of town, and it reminded me of doing what i can for the community (giving back in a small way (walking the talk)) and then i thought about all the times my mom nagged us about refilling the nearly empty brita filter pitcher. and i wonder if i’ve brown and somehow the act of me filling up this tray on my way out of town is a big fat symbol of that— or maybe it just means i’m better at serving my roommate than my parents. and that pitcher met it’s demise by being thrown into the yard in the night as a half joke half statement made by my dad who was fed up with all the back and forth anyway.
