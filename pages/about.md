<!-- ![Me Having Fun](me-having-fun.JPEG "Me Having Fun") -->

I'm so happy you're here! Because I have a lot to say.

I would like to announce that the intent of this blog is similar to that of a weekly newsletter. Although, I’m a lady well-acquainted with the anxiety of an email inbox, and I am not particularly interested in being associated with those emotions. So here we find ourselves (on a painfully generic pre-packaged blog that I found on the internet and cloned to my IDE of choice because I am constantly trying to _Prove a Point to No One_), and there are **almost** no rules! 

You may notice that there is no way to comment on any of the posts. Instead, I would be delighted if you would email me any and all of your thoughts at any time. You can do so by clicking the tiny envelope in the upper right hand corner of this very page.

Okay I am fairly certain that is the end of the rules. 

There are a lot of motivating forces behind this blog, i.e. my instagram hiatus, living in my hometown with my parents at 21, the freedom a lack of rigorous schoolwork brings, but most romantic: my desire for a **creative outlet**. In summer of 2020, I started writing in my notes app every night before bed. It became a sort of routine: I would turn off all of the lights, start playing [whatever playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1V1In2SScaYfSSz3hjYQlJ?si=0b6e71c94e394e04) I had made for the season, go outside to my roof, see if there was anything noteworthy about the night, decide there was but I was tired anyway, come back inside, browse [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/sophieggeee/_saved/), and write random thoughts about life and love in my notes app on my laptop. 

I can only assume that similar existential temptations will plague me this summer, as I am home again and in an eerily similar headspace. So here I am, and here you are, and I just hope you enjoy.
